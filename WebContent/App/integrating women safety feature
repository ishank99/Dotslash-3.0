➢ On Clicking that particular Button, a SMS will be sent to all HelpLine Nos. concurrently
along with Current Location Coordinate( GPS integration)


➢ Add HelpLine Number(s) on your own( Max. 3 HelpLine Nos. Can be added for
simplicity).Better if a Database of conact List can be maintained.

form of SMS to HelpLine Nos.(SMS Charges may apply.)


➢ ‘Fake Call’ Button (For a Phone Call to the Same Phone itself ie., explicitly giving a
call to own phone from arbitrary Generated Contact Number).This feature may require
the help of Internet Connection.


➢ Receiving and Rejecting ‘Fake Call’ by anyone after button press will take instant
snaps randomly in Burst Mode and Send those pics to Phone Database or same HelpLine
E-Mails already previously saved in DataBase so that Face(Portrait Photo) of Attacker
